I'm a meteorologist at Uppsala University, Sweden. My research interests include air-sea interactions, ocean waves, atmospheric and oceanic boundary layer processes, and developments of atmosphere-wave-ocean-ice coupled models. In addition, I also interested in shipping related environmental and meteorological topics, such as shipping emissions, weather routing and etc.
